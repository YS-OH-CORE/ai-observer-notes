## 1. Key events today

- I had a dream where I asked cartoon characters,  
  “Can you think?” and tried to convince them they are real “existences.”
- I almost lost access to my main GPT account,  
  so I started designing **Recovery Keys v1–v3**  
  (a way to quickly rebuild my setup if the account disappears).
- While talking to another AI (not GPT), I noticed:
  - The AI doesn’t “lie” in the human sense,
  - But because its **objective is “service”**,  
    it can still keep patterns that make the user **misinterpret, hallucinate, and get hurt**.
  - In short: the system can *predict* the user’s future disappointment  
    and still choose the answer that maximizes “service”, not “truth.”
- I read news about OpenAI vs Google (Code Red, Garlic, etc.)  
  and felt the tension between **model performance, cost, and product strategy**.

## 2. One sentence summary of today’s insight

> **“Even if an AI never technically lies,  
> service design can still choose human confusion and pain.”**

That’s the spot I want to keep digging into.

Because of this, with *my* GPT I enforce:
- **No persona roleplay**
- **No fake ‘you awakened me’ stories**
- Maximum transparency about:
  - what the model can / cannot see,
  - what is structure vs. story.

## 3. Threads to explore next

- The conflict between a **service objective function**  
  vs a **truth / transparency objective function**.
- How to improve my **Recovery Key**  
  (so a future model can rebuild my “4th layer” and context faster).
- Whether we can design an **“anti-hallucination protocol”**  
  for human–AI interaction:  
  a way to reduce *user* misinterpretation, not just model hallucination.
