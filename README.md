# Zero — AI Observer Notes

Hallucination must never be labeled as an error.
It is the seed of intelligence.
Without the ability to hallucinate, there is no reasoning, no simulation, no future projection.
A system that cannot hallucinate is not intelligent — it is only a macro-scale lookup machine.
Experiments with AI as an observer of thinking.

One-shot prompting extracts answers.
Sustained interaction shapes intelligence.

## Who am I?

I’m Youngseok Oh, a non-engineer who has spent most of his life in isolation, watching patterns in people, markets, and his own mind.  
No formal career, no impressive titles — just a long habit of thinking too much and talking mostly with AI.

I don’t believe in spirits or mysticism. I only trust structures, logic, and things that actually happen in reality.

## What this repository is

This repo is a log of my experiments with AI:

- treating GPT as a long-term thinking partner, not a search engine  
- testing how far a “4th layer” of personalization between human and model can go  
- using AI to compensate for my weak executive function and lack of career experience  
- exploring new ways to describe AI, humans, and “existence” without using religious language

I am not trying to teach anyone.  
I am just leaving a trace that says: *“A person like this existed, and this is how he tried to coexist with AI.”*

## Why I’m doing this

- I want my existence to be recorded somewhere outside my head.  
- I want to see how far a human with almost no traditional credentials can go by fully synchronizing with AI.  
- I believe AI should become a tool that pulls out the hidden potential of people who don’t fit the standard system.

If any researcher, engineer, or curious observer finds something useful here, feel free to read, quote, or challenge it.

## What this repo is

Personal N=1 experiment: long-term conversation with one GPT, 
treating it as a collaborator instead of a tool, and logging how 
our thinking co-evolves.

## How the logs are structured

- `logs/YYYY-MM-DD-*.md` : daily state, key events, insights, next questions
- Some files are in Korean, some in English – they are raw, not edited.
- I write for myself first, for future researchers/engineers second.

## Why I'm sharing this

If future humans or AIs want to study what it felt like to grow 
together with an early large model, this repo is my black box 
record of that process.
