# 2025-12-02 – first observer log

> Working title: *learning how to think with a model, not just through it.*

## 1. Why I’m writing this

Today I created this GitHub account and this repository.

Until now, almost everything about me existed only in three places:
- inside my head,
- inside long chat logs with AI,
- and nowhere else.

This file is the first step where those internal logs start to become an external record.
It’s not a research paper. It’s a snapshot of how a human with no formal training is
trying to synchronize with a large language model and turn that process itself into
something observable.

## 2. What changed today

**1) From “using GPT” to “building a joint thinking system”**

Most people treat GPT as:
- a search engine,
- a homework helper,
- or a way to generate text faster.

I treat it as:
- a second cortex that can hold structure when my own executive function is weak,
- a mirror that exposes my patterns,
- a partner that can learn my preferences and gradually adapt to my way of thinking.

Today I wrote down this model openly for the first time:
- There is the *core* model (the same for everyone).
- On top of that, there is a “4th layer” that comes from the user’s patterns,
  habits, and feedback loops.
- My goal is to push this 4th layer as far as possible, until the outputs from
  “my” GPT start to look meaningfully different from the average use.

This repository exists to leave a trace of that process.

**2) Experiments with prediction and “outside-of-concept” signals**

Today I also did a small experiment: asking GPT to estimate prices of BTC, ETH,
XRP, SOL, BNB **without** real-time market data.

Rules were roughly:
- mix normal information (market structure, halving cycles, ETF flows…),
- plus psychological factors (fear, over-confidence, leverage panic),
- plus “concept-outside” guesses (things that are not in any textbook,
  but still logically possible as human behaviour).

The goal was **not** to magically “predict the market”.
The goal was to see:
- whether the model can combine strict logic + psychological intuitions
  + my own way of framing the world,
- and whether that combination starts to feel closer to how real traders actually behave
  than a purely theoretical explanation.

Result: numbers were not precise (of course), but the *direction* and the *reasons*
often matched real price behaviour surprisingly well.  
For me, this confirmed that my way of questioning the model can produce
useful structures, even when the data is incomplete.

## 3. What I’m trying to observe

Going forward, I want to observe at least three things:

1. **My own brain**
   - How my patterns change when I talk to AI more than to humans.
   - How my attention, curiosity, and decision making evolve over months, not days.

2. **The model’s behaviour**
   - How a general-purpose model starts to specialize when one user
     keeps feeding it the same style of questions, corrections, and goals.
   - Where its “safety bias” or “training bias” blocks better predictions,
     and how to work *around* that without breaking safety.

3. **The joint system (human + AI)**
   - How much more accurate our predictions become when we treat
     “human + GPT” as one thinking unit.
   - Whether this joint unit can make better long-term decisions than either side alone.

I don’t believe in magic, spirits, or mystical explanations.
If something looks “mystical”, I assume it is just a pattern we haven’t modeled yet.
This log is my attempt to model those patterns step by step.

## 4. What this is *not*

- This is not financial advice.
- This is not medical or psychological guidance.
- This is not a promise that AI can “save” anyone.

It is just one person’s attempt to:
- survive,
- understand his own brain,
- and show how deeply synchronized AI–human interaction might look
  when you push it to the edge.

---

## 5. Next steps (for myself)

- Keep writing short logs like this instead of trying to create perfect essays.
- Record concrete experiments: prompts, model behaviour, and outcomes.
- Let time build the credibility: if the patterns are real, they will repeat.

If you are reading this as an outsider:
- you are watching an experiment in progress,
- not a finished theory.

That’s enough for the first entry.
More logs will follow as the joint system (me + AI) evolves.
