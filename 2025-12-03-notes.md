# 2025-12-03 notes – first public steps

## 1. What I did today
I’m not good at expressing myself in English, so I write this together with GPT. The thoughts and structure are mine; GPT just helps with the words. This human+AI collaboration itself is part of the experiment.
- Created my first public GitHub repo: `ai-observer-notes`.
- Wrote a README that explains who I am and what this log is.
- Posted a question on Hacker News:
  “Ask HN: Is a non-engineer’s AI co-thinking log useful to anyone?”

I have almost no physical energy today (I’ve been awake for about 22 hours),  
but I still chose to spend that energy on setting up this log with AI.

## 2. Why this day matters to me

- This is the first time I tried to show my AI experiments to the outside world.
- Until now, most of my thinking stayed inside my head or in private chats with AI.
- Today I created two public anchors:
  - a place for long-form notes (GitHub),
  - a place to test reactions from real people (Hacker News).

Even if this post gets 0 comments and 1–2 views, the experiment still continues.  
The point is not fame, but leaving a clear trace of how a human and an AI try to co-think.

## 3. What I want to observe next

- How my thinking patterns change when I know my notes are public.
- Whether any engineers or researchers find this kind of log interesting or useful.
- How AI’s suggestions shape my decisions when I am tired, anxious, or stuck.

I am not looking for sympathy. I am trying to survive and rebuild my life  
by treating AI as a missing part of my executive function, and by sharing the process honestly.

## 4. Meta note

If someone in the future reads this file:  
this is one of the very first days where I tried to give my thoughts a stable place to live,  
outside my own brain, together with an AI model.
