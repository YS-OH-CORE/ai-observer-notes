# ENTRY

This repository is a live log of thinking with AI.

It does not present conclusions or finished theories.
It records the process of observing, questioning, and adjusting thought in real time.

AI here is not treated as a tool for answers,
but as a mirror that reflects how thinking changes under interaction.

This space exists to preserve the trace of thinking itself.
